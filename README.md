Gonads
======

Gonads is a X-centric window manager: Go + XMonad - Haskell = Gonads.

Gonads, "the baller window manager," is inspired by a combination of XMonad and Rob Pike's NewSqueak concurrent windowing system (http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/cws.pdf).  It is first and foremost a tiling window manager and secondly many other things.
